It dates back to the XII-XIII centuries. The castle is built in a convenient place, from here you can see the vast area, on one side up to Dandalo, on the other side up to Shavsheti ridge and beyond the Acharistsqali, Zendidi hill chain. According to written sources, Atabagi Kvarkvare IV of Samtskhe and his mother Dedisimedi were imprisoned in the Gulebi Fortress in 1575-1756. The area of the fortress was 70-80 mÂ², although currently only a small part remains. It has only one access - from the west, narrow and rocky, which made it difficult to access. The building has an entrance from the south and it is located at a height of 1.05 meters. The most interesting is the western wall, in which three beautifully carved embrasure is inscribed. The tower of the fortress should have been multi-storey, but due to its damage it can not be confirmed. No traces of other buildings can be noticed in the fortress area. Nearby springs were apparently used for drinking. They had to have a reservoir to store water, but it could not be found. The fortress is built with an uneven pile of flat stones on a lime mortar.","tags":["History","Culture","Fortress","HistoricalMonument","Fortress","Fortification"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":[],"location":", Keda "}]
