Satsiviskhevi comes on the one hand of the fortress and Abanoskhevi - on the other. It dates back to the X-XI centuries and is built of crushed stone. The building mainly consists of two sections. The northern section is relatively small, large and the main section is located to the south. The fence is fortified with piers. Inside the fence are placement of fortress guards, reservoirs and other buildings. The entrance is from the north. The fortress is not huge, but it is difficult to approach. It protected the road from Shida Kartli to southern Georgia. In 1920, during the earthquake, the monument was badly damaged and it is impossible to determine the original type of plan and mass.\n","tags":["History","Culture","Fortress","HistoricalMonument","Fortress","Fortification"],"bestTimeToVisit":"Spring,Summer,Autumn","duration":"3 hours","images":["35797d3a-9eac7-41fa-8fce-10d17c9a84311f.jpg","5f897eb9-a6717-4504-861e-c6ccbaa96ee538.jpg","37b3907f-8606c-4831-8e3e-7e31b87868f861.jpg","53e9175b-bd2d5-43bd-89a8-c9cb9b818e6a27.jpg","6803581d-5b857-4ffc-8ef4-7b34c0d42d48c2.jpg"],"location":", Gori "}]
