It is a German church dating back to 1906. The building is in the Gothic style and is built of well-hewn squares of gray basalt of the local type. In the interior, the structure is made of rough-hewn flat stone because it was intended for plastering. The large building extending from south to north has a gate with a three-storey square bell tower in the style of a gazebo. The facades of the church are lined with pilasters, between which arched windows are cut. Placed in a thin bay window of the southern facade, the tympanum of the arched entrance is decorated with colored stained-glass windows, and the arch is decorated with double ornaments and a relief image of a cross. There is a five-step stone staircase in front of the entrance. The third floor of the gate, which is a bell tower, is decorated with arched windows doubled on three sides and rounded openings built in between them. On the side of the northern facade, in a protruding triangular apse, there are three arched windows and an entrance. The facades are crowned with profiled cornices.","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":["4612697e-4b83c-4d50-8e35-bed92f9f5f8db1.jpg","8a8d4132-85b6a-4408-a90d-47baa7e816106e.jpg","d52313c7-691fb-4e26-943f-0934d3b358b4a7.jpg","87f2ed62-8c449-4c58-b62c-57457c1c5f2f11.jpg"],"location":", Tsalka "}]
