The territory of Abkhazia is currently occupied by Russia. According to the Dadiani Chronicle, a church was built on the site of the present temple at the end of the 10th century, in 999, by Bagrat III, who was the first king of united Georgia:  \"In 999 Bagrat III Kouropalate, the son of King Gurgen I of Iberia, built Bedia.\" Bagrat III and his mother - Queen Gurandukht are buried here. The temple built by Begrat III has not survived to this day. In 1968, during the restoration works, Levan Khimshiashvili found the remains of the foundation and floor of the old temple, larger than the current one, built by Bagrat III. The present temple was built on old ruins in the second half of the 13th century and the reliefs of the original temple were used in its decoration. Bedia Monastery was distinguished by its beauty and wealth. From the treasure of Bedia temple, a wonderful sample of metal stamping, the famous Bedia Chalice (Golden Chalice) is preserved, which is now kept in the Museum of Art of Georgia. The inscriptions of the Bedia Temple are also noteworthy, which are important historical sources and provide us with information on the political and cultural life of the country. In the 2000s, the de facto government of Abkhazia restored the temple, destroying its original appearance, painting the monastery walls and frescoes, including a unique fresco of Bagrat III.","tags":["occupiedterritories","History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":[],"location":", Ochamchire "}]
