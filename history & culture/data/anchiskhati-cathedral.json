It is a three-nave basilica dating back to the 6th century and is the oldest church building in Tbilisi. The current name of the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary is connected with the icon of the Savior that came here from Anchi Monastery in South Georgia in 1664. The icon of the Savior of Anchi is an excellent example of Georgian stamping, it is carved by Beka Opizari and is currently kept in the Georgian National Museum. In the late Middle Ages, the Anchiskhati Church was an important center of religious and cultural life. Georgian princes were also brought up here. Descendants of the priest, Peter Moskhi, who came here from Samtskhe in the 17th century, were the founders of the Alexi-Meskhishvili dynasty. In 1755, with the support of the King Erekle II, a secular school and a theological seminary were established near the church. In the seminary, grammar, poetics, rhetoric, logic, physics, philosophy, arithmetic and Georgian language were taught along with the divine law and ecclesiastical history. The temple has been damaged and rebuilt many times.  Anchiskhati is one of the most important cultural monuments in Tbilisi.\n","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"","images":["1712c0b7-d2753-458b-875a-3975b86a236298.jpg","656b72c3-faf89-4069-9ac0-572315b2242ef2.jpg","98f7a80d-2980c-4e2e-bdba-8d7e5949dceb7b.jpg","1a86edfd-5a2d3-455d-a0d1-e1e73ed5d5b970.jpg","7bf2845b-55612-46a6-85f7-1744c52c229ac2.jpg"],"location":", Tbilisi "}]
