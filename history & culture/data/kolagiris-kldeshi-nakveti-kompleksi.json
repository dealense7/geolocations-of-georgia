It has a strategic location and was comfortable for living as well. The Iori River flows quite close to the complex; As it is known, during the invasions, the invaders usually moved along the river gorges, and from the Kolagiri complex it was possible to completely control the Iori gorge. Also from Kolagiri, is clearly visible a larger monastic complex  - the rocks of Didi Kvabebi. Initially, the complex should have been much larger, but today only seven caves have survived, of which only four are easily accessible. In three caves, the paintings on the walls are still preserved. Here we find a hall church carved into the rock, in which the painting of the XII-XIII centuries has been preserved. The frescoes of Koalgiri are distinguished by their masterful performance; here you can see both religious scenes and images of secular persons. The complex was carved into soft rocks and is currently in a serious condition: the rocks continue to crumble and the frescoes are damaged too, despite the fact that conservation work was carried out here in the 90s of the XX century. The Cave Complex of Kolagiri is one of the most important and interesting examples of Georgian culture.","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":["aae9b141-1f72f-436d-8fa0-9bb21d1d3ab849.jpg","53bee80d-cf762-4ac4-8a85-b08b41cb024123.jpg","04863c17-c975d-4bae-a98a-1ce2eb00f46831.jpg","ec8a640f-b86bf-4afa-ba01-a1da8d589f2f11.jpg","c3baca9b-5a8a5-4721-834e-1a7c62e4785ddc.jpg"],"location":", Sagarejo "}]
