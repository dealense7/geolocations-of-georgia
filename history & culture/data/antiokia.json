It dates back to the IV-V centuries. According to \"Kartlis Tskhovreba\", the temple was built by King Mirian's grandson and King Vakhtang Gorgasali's grandfather, King Archil in the IV-V centuries AD, after the expulsion of the Persians, as a sign of gratitude to God: The Greek inscription on the stone on the threshold of the church (the stone slab is now preserved in the Mtskheta Archaeological Museum) informs us that the architect of the temple was the Greek master Averlios Akolios. In the VIII century, during the Marwan ibn Muhammads crushing expeditions in Georgia, the temple was burned. It was thoroughly repaired in the XV-XVIII centuries. At this time, the original appearance of the church was almost completely changed, the edge of the east window was changed and the north window was cut. Presumably, the gate was also added at the same time, and the second floor of the gate should be built later, in the 16th-18th centuries. In the 90s of the twentieth century, the interior of the temple was plastered and painted. Today, there is a convent named after St. Stephen the First Martyr.","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":[],"location":", Mtskheta "}]
