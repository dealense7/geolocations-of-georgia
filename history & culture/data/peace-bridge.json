It connects Erekle II Street and Rike. The Peace Bridge has become one of the symbols of renewed Tbilisi. It was officially opened on May 6, 2010. The architect of the bridge is Michele de Luca (he is also the architect of the MIA building and the Presidential Palace), and the lighting designer is Philippe Martino (he owns the lighting design for the MIA building, the Presidential Palace and the TV tower). This glass bridge is especially beautiful at night when the lights are reflected in the water. Near the Peace Bridge is Rike Park, which is well-appointed, with amusement parks and perfect for walking and unwinding. From here you can also visit the Narikala by cable car and enjoy the wonderful views of the city from above. Narikala Fortress, Tbilisi Tower and the Presidential Palace are perfectly visible from the bridge. The Peace Bridge is one of the most popular places in Tbilisi. The modern design bridge brings eclecticism to the environment of old Tbilisi.\n","tags":["History","Culture","Architecture","Bridge","Infrastructure"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":["f3149766-f0b10-46db-9144-c0e9939a98813f.jpg","fde292e9-103cc-45af-8d68-371ddddbbcaeb6.jpg","11a63d01-55b97-4f06-821c-6f492ee8eed74a.jpg","f8dbba05-29bb8-4479-99be-751bf7173c9ad7.jpg","68c867f9-6de2d-4cc5-b175-120415f16bdb3e.jpg"],"location":", Tbilisi "}]
