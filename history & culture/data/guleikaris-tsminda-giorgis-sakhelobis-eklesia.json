It dates back to the late feudal era and was likely built on the site of an older church. The temple is a hall building with a semicircular gabled apse to the east. The facades are plain, indivisible, with only small reliefs involved, which do not play a significant role in the overall artistic solution. The building has very wide proportions. The entrance is two - west and south. The church was built from purely hewn blocks.","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":["971c90b3-53611-4826-9b8b-58902463491bfc.jpg","d4506ccd-b957b-4fb1-a952-99ebaaef811542.jpg","b7fd6bdf-791ca-464b-a6c3-0ca994b71ab519.jpg","9123bbf5-92caf-42fc-a8f3-a0382f78b6ce68.jpg"],"location":", Abasha "}]
