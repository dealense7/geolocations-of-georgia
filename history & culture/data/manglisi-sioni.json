According to historical sources, the first stone cathedral was built in this place during the proclamation of Christianity as a state religion in the 30s of the IV century. According to Leonti Mroveli, bishop John, who was sent by Constantine Caesar to Mirian King, brought sacred relics and abundant treasures to build churches in Georgia. He delayed at Manglisi before arriving in Mtskheta and started to build the temple, where he leftÂ  part of the Holy Cross of Christ. Among the bishopric founded by Vakhtang Gorgasali in the V century, Manglisi is the fourth in a row.","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 day","images":["92914026-ce908-48ac-8450-2c61b376103337.jpg","fd4f32b5-6f9b1-48b3-bee9-44c20ede98540a.jpg","cc5b51bb-3a035-44da-b2cf-e68eab063c442c.jpg","aedec243-a18c0-47df-9a1f-b47ad661d44f20.jpg","b62e05af-9b334-47dc-a36c-ed8a9ffde1371b.jpg"],"location":", Tetritskaro "}]
