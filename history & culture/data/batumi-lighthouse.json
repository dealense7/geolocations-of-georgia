The first lighthouse was built here in 1863. It was a cast iron column on which a dioptric lamp was mounted. In 1882, the old building was rebuilt by French constuctors, who built an octagonal stone lighthouse and erected a small cylindrical tower on top of it, where the lighting fixture was placed. It has been directing ships entering the Black Sea for more than 150 years, with its light reaching 14 nautical miles. The lighthouse building also houses a hydrographic service where weather forecasters are on duty 24 hours a day to observe meteorological conditions. Batumi Lighthouse is a progressive example of engineering art of its time and it is one of the sights of the city. Near the lighthouse is the Ferris wheel, from where you can enjoy amazing views of the city and the vast sea.
