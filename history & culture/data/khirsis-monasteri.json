The current temple dates back to the IX-X centuries, although the monastery here was founded by one of the Assyrian fathers, the worthy Stephen, in the VI century. Stephen Khirseli is buried in Khirsa Church. Vakhushti Batonishvili writes about the Khirsa Monastery: \"To the north of Khornabuji is located the Khirsa Monastery, which was built by St. Stephen, one of the 13 fathers, the great benefactor. St. Stephen is buried here\". There was a small church here in the VI century, at the turn of the IX-X centuries, by the order of Kvirike I, the King of Kakheti, it was transformed into a domed church. In the 40s of the XVI century, during the reign of Levan, the King of Kakheti, the church was renovated. Khirsa Monastery has been a missionary center for centuries. It was one of the places from where Georgian clergymen tried to introduce Christianity to the Lekos (Dagestan). There are three versions of the etymology of the name of the monastery: according to one version, the word \"khirsa\" should be derived from the word \"worthy\", according to another version, it should be named after the small river Khirsa, and according to the third version, Khirsa was a place in Palestine and maybe the Holy Father who came from Syria named the monastery after it.","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":[],"location":", Sighnaghi "}]
