[{"title":"St. George Church of Tetrosni","categories":"Church / Monastery","pin":"church","coordinates":[],"about":"St. George Church of Tetrosni is located in the village of Khutsubani, Kobuleti Municipality, Adjara. Tetrosani was one of the most important cultural centers of the Khinotsminda Episcopate. This name is associated with the cult of White George. According to another version, the Virgin Mary was mentioned in white (dressed in white) in Georgia. There is an assumption that in prehistoric times there must have been a cult center here. The icon of the Virgin of Tetrosni was famous, which, according to Dimitri Bakradze, was transferred to the Aketi Savior Cathedral by Tavdgiridzes. According to the people mentioned in the inscription of the icon, it must have been created in Samegrelo and later in Guria. Another icon of Tetrosni was moved to Dzimiti by the Gugunaves. Tetrosani was a literary and cultural center, where the \"Psalter of Tetrosani\" of the XVI century was copied. The old temple of Tetrosani belonged to the V-VI centuries, although only a small remnant of this temple survives. A new church was built next to the ruins of the early church in the 90s of the XX century. \n","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"","images":["d742ab03-0375c-4edf-a7ff-3603ffce235f0e.jpg","c9225cdc-c1269-4c7b-9c81-31576300483de9.jpg","b724a3d0-4b993-4f21-b874-a06799b118f9ae.jpg","5b202c07-618be-46c7-a185-b721b618d45157.jpg","7fd4b675-99334-4422-b0d3-4d1324c7ed33fa.jpg"],"location":"Adjara"}]
