It is first mentioned in Georgian sources in 1721. The monks left Hujabi monastery during one of the enemies’ invasions. In 1905, a Russian Orthodox nunnery was established here, which existed until 1935. According to what Igumenia Pavla, the head of the nunnery says about the monastery, the nuns were exiled from the Hujabi monastery in 1935 for unknown reasons. They found the shelter in the village of Akhkerpi and set up a chapel in one of the residential place. During the Soviet Union time Hujabi monastery was included in the territories of Georgia. The monument confirms it is Georgian by both, the architectural features and the Georgian inscriptions of the church. The monastery is located near the Georgian-Armenian border. This territory became controversial since Armenian border guards opened fire to the film crew of television “Mze”. The media reported that the border guards illegally crossed the border, after that Hujabi has been under Armenian control. \n","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":[],"location":", Marneuli "}]
