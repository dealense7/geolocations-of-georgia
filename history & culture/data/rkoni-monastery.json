In the XII-XIII centuries, important trade and military-strategic roads passed through Rkoni that was connecting Shida Kartli with Javakheti, Trialeti and the Middle East. This contributed to the reconstruction of Rkoni monastery. In 1400, Tamerlane's armies raided the village, the surrounding churches and monasteries. In the XVI-XVIII centuries, Rkoni was still a well-fortified place, but it was becoming empty gradually. The monastery complex has been rebuilt many times over the centuries. Basically, three layers of construction can be distinguished: VII, XIII-XIV centuries and XVII-XVIII centuries. In 1905, a workshop-laboratory was established in Rkoni, where weapons and explosive substances were made for the rebellion.\n","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"3 hours","images":["8fcd852f-f3741-4f7a-90af-4ae6b7c1c05ad2.jpg","aeed9cd3-25573-48b6-9464-9779e981b7d649.jpg","a847576c-6df5f-4bf8-8bc5-4cd52d8fdefda7.jpg","b49fc2a7-19f9a-4ff2-a78b-72008b47d4f590.jpg","b9a69075-60643-41bd-af26-4d7dbe69d835ab.jpg"],"location":", Kaspi "}]
