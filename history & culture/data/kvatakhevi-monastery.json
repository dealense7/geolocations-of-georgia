The monument belongs to XII-XIII centuries. It was considered to be the main monastery of Kartli and was protected by Georgian aristocrats. During Temur Lang's invasion in 1386, the monastery was raided. When the nuns sheltered in the church and the villagers refused to convert from Christianity, they were locked together in the monastery and set fire to the church. In the XV century, King Alexander the Great rebuilt the Kvatakhevi Monastery. In 1735-1740 the monastery was closed, and the relics that were kept in the monastery, were hidden in a cave close to the monastery. At the end of the XVIII century, the church was reopened and the hidden treasure was returned to the monastery. According to legend, a small part of the Virgin Mary's clothes is buried in the foundation of the church (the monastery itself has got a name of Virgin Mary). Also the greatest holy thing in the monastery is the holy part of John the Baptist. Kvatakhevi was also one of the centers of ancient Georgian literature, and several manuscripts of the monasteryâ€™s library have survived till today.
