It must have been built in the XIV-XVI centuries. Likhauri Fortress was captured by the Turks in 1774, along with Askani Fortress and Bukistsikhe, although it was recaptured in the same year by Mamia IV Gurieli and Solomon I. During the Russo-Ottoman War, when Karl Hesse entered Guria, Sophio Gurieli took refuge in Likhauri Fortress. It is known from historical sources that the ruler of Upper Adjara, Ahmed Beg, ordered Sophio Gurieli to be handed over to Askani and Likhauri. Sophio Gurieli wrote in response: \"I can not give these two fortresses: I can not give these two prisons: in one is my residence and in the other, I have my children.\"According to Tedo Sakhokia, who was in Likhauri in 1896, a Russian military unit was stationed in the fortress. In the XIX century, Likhauri fortress was sheltered by firals. Dubois de Montpéreux, Dimitri Bakradze, and Tedo Sakhokia visited and described the castle at different times. Likhauri Fortress is also described by Ekvtime Takaishvili, who was originally from the village of Likhauri.","tags":["History","Culture","Fortress","HistoricalMonument","Fortress","Fortification"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"","images":["227fa61f-55785-45ca-8562-bf5f915478554b.jpg","d446cc40-543c5-4c61-81dd-a086550b802808.jpg","aff7b211-57905-4401-89ca-bfc6db7ec812ec.jpg","95b3fbf0-4dd1e-455f-905f-7ae6ddfea89cea.jpg","2468d26f-26388-4d39-8140-42a02c0ca888c0.jpg"],"location":", Ozurgeti "}]
