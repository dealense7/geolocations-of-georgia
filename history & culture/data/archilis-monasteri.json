The oldest of the buildings is the VIII century hall temple. There is a tomb in the temple: it is considered that the Kakhetian eismtavari (literally, \"chief of the people\", ruler) Archil, the son of Stephen of Kakheti, is buried here. During the Middle Ages, a second church was built at the northeastern corner of this church, and in the 17th-18th centuries, a tower and other buildings were added.","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"","images":[],"location":", Taineti "}]
