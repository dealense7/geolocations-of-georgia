It was built by Queen Darejan in 1788-1798. During this period, Kvemo Kartli was in a very difficult situation: the majority of the population was not Georgian, and the Christian population was severely oppressed. Due to this reason, building a fortress became necessary. It is known that the Pasha of Akhaltsikhe repeatedly attacked the fortress during its construction in order to stop this process. The fortress is located in an open area, which is easily approachable from all sides. It is noteworthy that at the same time it fully meets all the military-strategic requirements and capabilities of its time. Since the beginning of the 19th century, the Kolagiri fortress, like other fortresses, has lost its function. Today, on the territory of the fortress, there is a nunnery named after the Ketevan the Martyr (Queen of Georgia).","tags":["History","Culture","Fortress","HistoricalMonument","Fortress","Fortification"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"","images":[],"location":", Bolnisi "}]
