The complex includes a cathedral, a palace, and a fence. The cathedral is situated in a courtyard enclosed by a fence, on the even place. The church is a three-aisled basilica, surrounded on three sides, which is not connected to the main church by a pile. The south and north wings of the perimeter are independent churches, while the west wing is the gate. G. Chubinashvili, who studied the temple in 1920, dates it to the X-XI centuries and presumes that it was built according to a unified plan, but in two ways. In his opinion, the original project envisaged the construction of a three-nave basilica, which was rejected during the construction process (apparently for financial reasons). Namely, they first built the middle boat, which was completely covered with shirim cut stone from the outside, and later the side wings were made of cobblestone. Inside, the apse of the main church, with shoulders - is made of shirim, and the rest of the walls are made of cobblestone. The main church is three times wider and much taller than the adjacent churches.\n","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":["7c100d89-902ec-4147-97d9-f4b6756512e922.jpg","2cf6456f-f3775-4324-98fd-d55717e716abd0.jpg","c37c8923-aa5e9-47e3-ad2d-d27c6213e9476b.jpg","29ec902f-d778d-479f-9e74-257a6292f953ca.jpg","be2d6803-3f4dc-4550-9108-6eff445681aed1.jpg"],"location":", Gurjaani "}]
