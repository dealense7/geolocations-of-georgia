It is located in Kartli, Mtskheta municipality, 40 km from Tbilisi, on the left bank of the river Mtkvari.\n It was founded in the second half of the 6th century by Shio, one of the Assyrian fathers. According to the sources, Shio spent the last years of his life in a dark and deep cave, and after his death, according to his will, he was buried there (hence the name \"Shio's Cave\", \"Shiomghvime\"). His tomb was considered a sacred place in Shiomghvime.  Shiomghvime was also an old Georgian cultural-literary center. Shio Mghvimeli, Basil Karichi (XI century), Arsen Ikaltoeli, Arsen Beri, Giorgi Khutsesmonazon (XIII-XIV centuries), Theodosius (1878-1881) and others worked here.
