It was built in 1910. In 1909, the newspaper \"Droeba\" informs us: \"Georgian Jews find it very difficult to finish their chapel in Tbilisi, because a lot of money is needed for such a huge building. The building is beautiful and noteworthy. The building is finished from the outside. Only the internal area isn’t fully done.  They also have to build a school and Georgian Jews expect help from their believers. This great building was built entirely with the contribution of Georgian Jews.  European or Russian Jews don’t have any connection with Georgian Jews. The Jews who arrived here have two synagogues in Tbilisi, but Georgian Jews are still building their own synagogue.”\n","tags":["History","Culture","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":["1bb88ec3-1d5e5-4602-8570-46a48a63d1a42d.jpg","4cc0477c-b253e-4e1c-862a-7a63247b78333a.jpg","4527cc66-4d46c-4cea-8a0e-30b3dc6cd44d97.jpg"],"location":", Tbilisi "}]
