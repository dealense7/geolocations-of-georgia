It's one of the most iconic samples of medieval church architecture. The temple is a cross-dome building. According to the plan, it is a cross-in-square construction, with elongated transepts to the east and west. The eastern transept ends with a semicircular apse placed in the rectangle. To the north and south of the apse, a square-shaped altar and sacristy are located. To the west of the temple, at the top tier, there is a choir (an area in the church, that provides seating for the nobles and church choir). The dome rests on arches supported by four piers. The high neck of the dome is divided by twelve arched windows. The decoration of the facades of the church is created with a composition of arch systems and relief crosses made of bricks. The building has three entrances - from the west, south and north. The church was built of Kakhetian bricks.","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":[],"location":", Telavi "}]
