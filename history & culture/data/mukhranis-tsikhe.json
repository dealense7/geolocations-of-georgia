The monument dates back to the 18th century. In recent periods, it was the seat of the House of Mukhrani. Above the gates of the citadel, there is an inscription, which says that in the 30s of the 18th century the fortress was built by Mamuka Mukhranbatoni with the help of Levan Mukhranbatoni. And in 1756 the damaged fortress was restored by sakhltukhutsesi (lord chancellor in feudal Georgia) Constantine III (Konstantine Mukhranbatoni). According to the inscription, at this time the fortress was ravaged by the enemies. During the invasions, the population of not only the village of Mukhrani but also of nearby villages used the Mukhrani fortress as shelter along with their property. The last owner of the fortress was Ivane Mukhranbatoni, after whose death his successor Konstantine Mukhranbatoni sold the palace. The fortress was used for different purposes in different periods.","tags":["History","Culture","Fortress","HistoricalMonument","Fortress","Fortification"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":["85e03761-242eb-4416-8cbf-4f864941819cb2.jpg","1637d24e-de33a-4a8b-9422-7b07dc81f65cec.jpg","94ab8dcf-7dc16-4580-98f6-2793ab7953a24c.jpg","903b5199-6e2e5-4321-aafb-817967914a33b4.jpg","dbc280c6-790dc-4729-b58a-b9fbe51d47ec4c.jpg"],"location":", Mtskheta "}]
