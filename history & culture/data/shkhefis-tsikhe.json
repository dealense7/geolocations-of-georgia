There are four construction layers on the monument, the earliest dates back to the beginning of the IV century, and the latest - to the XVI-XVII centuries. It was an important fortress in the IV-XIX centuries, and for some time was also the residence of the Dadiani dynasty. The history of Shkhepi Fortress dates back to the founding of the Kingdom of Egrisi and it was one of the links in the overall chain of protection of the kingdom. There is no written record of the early period of the Skhepi Fortress. There are two records of the late centuries when the fortress belonged to the Dadiani dynasty, the ruler of Samegrelo. According to Vakhushti Bagrationi, in 1582, Mamia Dadiani captured the young Leon, who was a rival for the throne, and imprisoned him in the Shkhepi fortress, who could not stand the captivity, fell from the fortress fence and died. The second information tells us that  Levan, the King of Imereti and Mamia Dadiani fought in Odishi in 1590. Mamia Dadiani won this war and imprisoned King Levan in Shkhepi fortress. The king died in the castle.","tags":["History","Culture","HistoricalMonument","Fortress","Fortification"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":["984819ba-95a54-4a25-bb6b-2c95bbc579a225.jpg","e193e5b4-0e7ef-4a4f-9282-28aacb6114f642.jpg","26017b70-1fc9e-4f20-8aef-9c3fb3c9a08f5a.jpg","b35990b7-22a38-4e55-997f-df0db98f319c44.jpg","4dc52ef4-3be6e-4868-89cf-b10d3314b796bb.jpg"],"location":", Senaki "}]
