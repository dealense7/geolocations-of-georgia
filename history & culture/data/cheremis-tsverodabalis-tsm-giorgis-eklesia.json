The architectural monument belongs to the V-VI centuries. It is structurally a three-aisled basilica, and it seems that the project was conceived in the same way. However, it differs somewhat from this type of buildings. As it became clear after the cleaning of the church, these differences were determined by the changes made during the construction process. There are several opinions regarding the structure and date of the building: G. Chubinashvili considers it a three-aisled basilica and dates it to the VI-VII centuries. In his opinion, the building was constructed at the same time, according to a unified plan.","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":["ba7a0624-7f4a2-4ca9-a55a-8347bc16ebe753.jpg","53c64494-fbe4f-4a0a-b2f8-951968a5ed8d92.jpg","28276803-1b62b-4ce7-b733-09c2219c483aab.jpg","31a11fea-082b1-4133-a860-2176ad4c5b82a6.jpg","8faece8c-bff58-447f-a557-3851e204ce1ede.jpg"],"location":", Gurjaani "}]
