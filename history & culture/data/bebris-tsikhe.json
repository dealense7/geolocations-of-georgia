It is also known as Beltistsikhe. In the ancient period, on the site of the fortress, there was some other building, as evidenced by the archaeological materials found here, but its purpose is still unknown. Remains of masonry and mud walls of IV-VI centuries, on which a fortress dating from the developed Middle Ages was built, have also been identified. In written sources, Bebris Tsikhe is first mentioned by a historian during the reign of King Lasha Giorgi (George IV of Georgia): \"King Demetrius died in Bebris Tsikhe and was transferred to Gelati to a new monastery consecrated by him.\" Archaeological excavations in 2006-2008 revealed that it was a functioning fortress until the 18th century. Bebris Tsikhe is located in a strategically advantageous place. It served as a guard for the approach to the city from the north. In 2010, prolonged downpours caused a landslide, causing the northeastern wall of the fortress to collapse, as well as cracking the rest of the walls. Currently, the monument is restored.","tags":["History","Culture","Fortress","HistoricalMonument","Fortress","Fortification"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":[],"location":", Mtskheta "}]
