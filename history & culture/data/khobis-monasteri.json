It is one of the most important monuments of the XIII-XIV centuries. The monastic ensemble includes a temple, a palace, a bell tower, a fence and the remains of ancillary buildings. The oldest document that mentions the Khobi Monastery is the agape included in the Jvari Monastery Chronicle. The construction of the temple is associated with the names of King Gubaz, David the Builder, Queen Tamar and Tsotne Dadiani. The church received special attention from the family of Shergil Dadiani. The temple preserves frescoes of Shergil, his wife Nateli and the young Tsotne. Khobi Monastery was also known for its cultural and religious heritage. Before the establishment of the Soviet government, the robe of the Virgin Mary, the thigh of St. George, the arm of St. Marine, the hand of St. Kvirike, the cross of Queen Tamar and other relics were rested in the church of Khobi. Information about this can be found in the records of the Italian missionary Archangelo Lambert. He describes that the robe of the Mother of God was shown in the Khobi Monastery, which was highly respected by the locals.","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"","images":["fd2d4c7b-db464-472e-8a27-32c28ccad8bb59.jpg","5ab31a0f-9b62f-4a59-b23e-6790458d8fc7c7.jpg","a0f58f53-1e28a-41cb-84a2-207b9797579c2a.jpg","57646c6f-2d145-47d7-80e8-59e077351a3b92.jpg","d138a219-3a726-45cc-a8fb-349701a492a1d6.jpg"],"location":", Khobi "}]
