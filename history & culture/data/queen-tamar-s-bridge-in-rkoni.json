It is part of the Rkoni monastery complex. In the XII-XIII centuries, Shida Kartli passed through important trade and military-strategic roads connecting Shida Kartli with Javakheti, Trialeti and the Middle East. This contributed to build the monastery in Rkoni. The complex consists of monuments of different periods. Rkoni Bridge is located on the river Tedzami and dates back to the XII-XIII centuries. It is a semicircular bridge with 12.5 m long and 2.2 m wide. The bridge imposts are based on a natural rock foundation and they are built of crushed stone on lime mortar.
