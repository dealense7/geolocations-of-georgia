It is a temple of the Early Medieval Period and it dates back to 626-634. The modern church is built on the site of an earlier temple from the 4th century. According to written sources, in 457, Razhden the Protomartyr was tortured to death in the early church of Tsromi, who converted to Christianity in the time of King Vakhtang Gorgasali. Today's monument was built by the order of Stephanos II. The church was damaged and rebuilt several times over the centuries (XI-XII, XVI-XVII centuries and XX century). On September 24, 1731, during the invasion of the Dagestanis, the fence was destroyed. During the earthquake on May 8, 1940, the dome of the temple, the walls of the dome square, most parts of the narthex and cylindrical arches from the arms of the west-south walls were collapsed and the west wall was inclined. Restoration work carried out in the second half of the twentieth century restored the temple to its original appearance. The Tsromi Temple is one of the most important and notable monuments of the early Middle Ages.","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"","images":[],"location":", Khashuri "}]
