It is a medieval building. It is less explored and used as an intelligence-monitoring point. According to the legend, the fortress was built by Elia Diasamidze to hide the kidnapped captives. There is also a legend that during the Ottoman rule, it was one of the points of sale of captives. The castle is an oval shape. Fragments of the fence in some places reach 3-4 meters, and in some places the rock forms a wall. Remains of various buildings can be seen on the territory of the fortress.
