The church was constructed in the late Middle Ages. It is a hall, built of an irregular pile of crushed stone. The outer corners of the building are made of much larger, more or less processed stones. From the exterior, the door-window openings are lined with pure cut sandstone and shirim stone. The interior is plastered and whitewashed. The church has two entrances - from the south and from the west. The south door ( bricked up) is rectangular and is enclosed in a semicircular arch-finished area on the outside. The facade of the arch is much smaller than the width of the recess and rests on sandstone imposts, the profile of which consists of a shelf, a shaft, and a slightly concave surface (similar to the rest of the imposts in the church). The entrance inside is rectangular as well. There is a semicircular tympanum on top of it. The west door, which was later slightly narrowed, is covered with solid wooden poles on both sides.
