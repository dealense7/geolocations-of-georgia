The main temple dates back to the 11th century, although the date of its construction is unknown. Small St. Nino's Church dates back to the 11th century, but it is known that the church was first built by King Mirian in the 4th century. This church is also mentioned in the life of St. Nino. The history of the Samtavro Nunnery dates back to 1820. While monastic life in Georgia was disappearing, ten nuns in Mtskheta laid the foundation for the establishment of a monastery. They also restored the small temple of St. Nino. During the Soviet period, mothers were sometimes trained as textile workers to save the monastery. There are candle making, art, sewing and other workshops. The monastery works on separate editions, such as \"Principality\" and a book of memoirs about monk Gabriel - \"Monk's Diadem\". Samtavro is one of the most important and noteworthy monuments in Mtskheta from the historical and cultural point of view.","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"","images":[],"location":", Mtskheta "}]
