It is a complex cut into the rocks that was built in the IX-XI centuries. At first it was called White Senaki, but later it was called Mravaltskaro because of the springs near the monastery (Mravaltskaro means much spring water). The complex includes five churches, which are cut into two floors on the south slope of the mountain. One of the churches has a completely unique dome that consists of three cylinders. There are frescoes, inscriptions and a unique scene on the complex, which shows us an army of warriors with camels and also armed with spears. The oldest inscription which you can found here, is Gareja inscription dated September 8 of 851. One can see the wall built with stones near to the monastery. It is not yet known whether this wall dates back to pre-Christian times or the middle ages. This complex is one of the unique and remarkable monuments of Georgian culture.\n","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":[],"location":", Gardabani "}]
