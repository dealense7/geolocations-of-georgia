It was built in 1609 by Mamia II Gurieli to appease the soul of his young son, Manuchar, who died while hunting in the area. He also donated cross-icons, books, a golden omophorion, a sakkos, and guns to the temple. The church was consecrated by Theophanes, Patriarch of Jerusalem, and it belonged to the Patriarchate of Jerusalem along with the churches of Baileti and Mamati. The Temple of Chekhedana was established under subordination of the Monastery of the Cross in Jerusalem, which meant that the Patriarch of Jerusalem, who had arrived in Guria, should perform the liturgy here.\n","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":[],"location":", Kobuleti "}]
