The monument got its name because of the blue roof, decorated with glazed tiles. The temple was built in the XII century on the site of an older church, parts of which were used during the construction of a new monastery. The monument has undergone many changes, as a result of which it has not reached us in its original form. It was damaged by the Persian invasion in the 16th century, but later in the 17th century, its destroyed part was rebuilt from bricks. Initially, it was a domed building, which was similar to other temples in Kartli of the XII-XIII centuries, but in the XVII century it was restored without a dome and the interior decoration gave the appearance of a basilica. In 1873, the church was rebuilt again, a Russian dome was erected, uncharacteristic for Georgian architecture, as well as new walls and pediments, which disfigured the monument. According to legend, in the VII century, a monastery named after St. John the Apostle functioned on this place. The current church, the inscription on the tympanum (inner field of the triangular pediment or gable) of the southern entrance, was built by the former archbishop of Kartli - Basili. In the 18th century, it belonged to the Gabashvili family. In the 19th-20th centuries, the temple periodically housed a warehouse, a sawmill, and a museum of the history of medicine. In 1990, the Russian dome of the building was replaced with a hipped roof, and the divine service was restored.","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"","images":[],"location":", Tbilisi "}]
