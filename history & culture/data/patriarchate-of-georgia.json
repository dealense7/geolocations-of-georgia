There was the palace of King Rostom in this place. Construction of the present building began in 1809 on the ruins of a palace for representative of Tsarist Russia. In the following period, the government of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Exarch and his services were established here. The building has been reconstructed many times, although classicist motifs can still be seen on the facades. Until the 80s of the XX century, there was a civil militia division here, then the Georgian Art Institute. In 1990, the complex was handed over to the Catholicos-Patriarch for accommodation and church services. This building is a union of Georgian patriarchal institutions within the Georgian Orthodox Church.  It assists with its departments and services to the Catholicos-Patriarch of Georgia to implement executive power. The Patriarchate has its own publishing house, radio and television","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"","images":["fa4f5942-1a42a-4030-86ad-420ec1029441be.jpg","6b6bec4d-2e733-4b45-a9e0-d49a0086427fec.jpg"],"location":", Tbilisi "}]
