In the past, a small chapel of Georgian Orthodox Christians stood on the site of today's church. Currently, only part of the apse is visible from it, and the rest of the walls are under the floor of the current temple. In the 15th century, Armenians from Tbilisi founded a monastery named after the Virgin Mary, which was called Petkhain. A new church was built in the first half of the 18th century. Bethlehem was a sacred and important place for both Armenians and Georgians, so representatives of both nationalities contributed to its construction. In 1740, Givi Amilakhvari, a famous public figure and philanthropist, made a great sacrifice for the temple. In 1884 the church was thoroughly repaired, the facade was renovated, and the dome of the temple is from the same period. During the Soviet era, church services were suspended. Since 1994, the Church of the Nativity of the Savior in Upper Bethlehem has belonged to the Georgian Orthodox Church. Excellent views of Tbilisi can be seen from the Bethlehem Church.\n","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"","images":["f10c4d01-5dc3f-41bb-a435-9b28a1460a9215.jpg","b0b80d35-23c67-4c09-bc5f-fd0412adf23721.jpg","ef4e3466-8b8b9-4025-b7ca-4ea034f8f2f9f4.jpg","74558dd9-10a35-46b8-93b1-04f489623a1337.jpg"],"location":", Tbilisi "}]
