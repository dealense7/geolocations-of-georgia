It dates back to the first half of the 17th century. The Kvareli fortress had a special strategic purpose, it was used only during martial law. The battle of Kvareli is associated with this fortress, in which the Georgian army fought against the Avar khan Nursal Bek. The king of Kartli Teimuraz II and the king of Kakheti Erekle II (Heraclius II), with the help of a perfectly calculated plan, forced Nursal Bek to retreat. The defense of the Kvareli fortress was of great importance for the future of Georgia. If the enemy had won and the fortress had fallen, then the conquest of all of Kakheti and Kartli would have been simplified.","tags":["History","Culture","HistoricalMonument","Fortress","Fortification"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":[],"location":", Kvareli "}]
