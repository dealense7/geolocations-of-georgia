It dates back to the IV-VI centuries. The complex includes the fortress and the Church of the Holy Archangel. The buildings were badly damaged, but today they are restored. The fortress has an oval shape and rests against a steep rock from the north side. The walls are supported by counterforts added later. In the central part of the fortress, stands a large hall-type church. On the east side, the hall ends with a semicircular protruding apse. The altar is one step higher. The interior is illuminated through six windows: one on the east and west sides and two on the longitudinal walls. On the stones of the walls of the temple, there are traces of ornamentation and natural colors, which, apparently, were reused after its renovation. The facades are crowned with cornices with shafts and fillets. The building has three entrances - from the west, south and north. The temple is faced with cut stone.","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":[],"location":", Senaki "}]
