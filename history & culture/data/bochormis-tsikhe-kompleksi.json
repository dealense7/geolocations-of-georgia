Bochorma Fortress was an important strategic point in the 10th century, it was also the political center of Kakheti. In 914 the castle was temporarily occupied by the Arabs. For some time, along with other important fortresses of Kakheti, it was owned by Bagrat IV,  but he was soon forced to cede it together with Ujarma to the king of Kakheti-Hereti, Aghsartani, in exchange for the treasure of Amira Phadlon. In the XVIII century, a significant part of the castle was rebuilt by Erekle II. In 1747, the battle between Erekle II and Abdul-Beg, the heir to the throne, intensified and the king was fortified in Bochorma fortress. Bochorma Castle was operational until the XVIII century.
