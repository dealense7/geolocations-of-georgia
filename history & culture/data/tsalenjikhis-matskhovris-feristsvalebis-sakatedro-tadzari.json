This is the X-XIII century tombstone. Before the temple, there had been a fortress. We can suppose so, according to the fundament of the building. The episcopacy here was prescribed in the middle of 1639-1650, with the initiative of Levan II. The first bishop from Tsalenjika is thought to be Mitrophane, the metropolitan of Alaverdi. Queen Ketevan, who was killed in Iran with torture, in 1624, carried away the icon of the Virgin Mary. Mitrophane was the one, who saved this image, dangerously escaped with it from Persia, and migrated to Levan Dadiani.","tags":["History","Church","Culture","Monastery","HistoricalMonument"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"","images":["144564da-01fc6-49ec-adc7-76871bda9f6d4c.jpg","7af91df9-c15f3-4a12-a37a-ea55887b370af8.jpg","a9883f34-5d5ad-4eed-ae1b-a4e31bbe0c317c.jpg","6bcad217-1afff-4594-83d1-ceee803db02c64.jpg","e60dff89-252f6-4147-a849-bb435f576e9a3f.jpg"],"location":", Tsalenjikha "}]
