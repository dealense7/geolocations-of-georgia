[{"title":"Skhvavi Glacier","categories":"Cave","pin":"cave","coordinates":[],"about":"Skhvavi Glacier-  this well is located in Racha, in the municipality of Ambrolauri, near the village Shua Skhvava (which means “middle Skhvava” in Georgian), about 4 kilometers from the countryside, on 1310 meters from sea level. The well has a huge funnel, and the bottom of it is covered up with snow. This funnel leads you to a steep, inclined cave. In the cavin, we see frozen stalactites, stalagmites, age-old icy columns, and pillars, as well as cascades. Everything together creates marvelous sightings. Skhvavi glacier has two sections. It is easy to get in the first part, but if you want to overcome another part of it, you would use special equipment. Here you will need a rope or you should cut the steps yourself through the ice, to get down. The temperature in this glacier is below zero during the whole year. Skhvavi Glacier is of the most interesting and impressive places in Racha.","tags":["Nature","Cave","Cave","Underground"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"","images":[],"location":"Racha"}]
