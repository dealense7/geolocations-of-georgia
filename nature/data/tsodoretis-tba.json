This place is great for a picnic, unwinding in nature with family or friends. The lake is very small and a large part of it is covered with aquatic plants, however, the forested ridges and open spaces create a very beautiful environment. The road goes to the lake, so if you can not go on long routes for a long time, you will be able to get to Lake Tsodoreti very easily and get away from the city noise.","tags":["Nature","Lake","Water"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":[],"location":"Mtskheta - Mtianeti"}]
