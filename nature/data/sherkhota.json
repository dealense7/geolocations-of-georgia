The mount is clearly visible from Gudauri. There are different ways to get there but more often people visit it from the route of Kelitsadi Lake because Sherkhota is situated exactly next to Khelitsadi Lake. It is possible to climb the mount Sherkhota without any special equipment, that does not represent difficulty. It is completely covered with volcanic red rubble, which makes it a bit difficult to climb, but instead, you can enjoy jogging on the rubble while landing.","tags":["Nature","Snow","Peak"],"bestTimeToVisit":"Summer","duration":"3 days","images":[],"location":", Stepantsminda "}]
