The village Arsha is 5 m away from Kazbegi. The way from the village to the waterfall is just 2 km. here, on the Arshistskhali river (means “Arshi water” in Georgian language) is two waterfalls. From the village you aren’t able to see the first waterfall, walking on the path you will suddenly come across it, like it burst out from the earth, like a miracle. The other waterfall is called “Woman’s Hair”, as it is flowing down from the boulder, like it is woman’s splendid plait.","tags":["Nature","Waterfall","Water"],"bestTimeToVisit":"Spring,Summer,Autumn","duration":"1 hour","images":["14ac0369-2c0f9-43ef-9e8c-38d5e834e16081.jpg","83855dd1-8dbed-4fe2-a506-5b02fcd7e0d73c.jpg","908a4d8d-e8074-489a-9b45-1bc24eb77cae1a.jpg","548fb318-0d194-44f8-aedc-9dd8390c5fadec.jpg","9a1dc2b8-2c21c-47cb-a97d-a2a4845ca783ab.jpg"],"location":"Mtskheta - Mtianeti"}]
