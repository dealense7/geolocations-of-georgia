It is very small in size, especially in August, when the water level drops significantly. Despite its small size, the iridescent blue lake, surrounded by flower fields and beautiful views, is an amazing spectacle. There are also summer pastures and a camp of Shepherds. Open spaces, a variety of flowers, huts on the slopes of the mountains, a gentle mountain breeze and meadows are very attractive for those who love nature and wander through the mountains.","tags":["Nature","Lake","Water","Infrastructure","PopulatedArea","Farm","SummerFarm"],"bestTimeToVisit":"Spring,Summer,Autumn","duration":"1 hour","images":[],"location":", Adigeni "}]
