In 1977, after the  new Soviet Constitution, the Supreme Council of the Georgian SSR developed a draft constitution, according to which, unlike the 1936 Constitution, Georgian Language was no longer declared the state language of Georgia. The initiation was followed by protests. On April 14, 1978, a large protest was held in the Mother Language Park, demanding the preservation of the language's status, leaving the Georgian state language. A monument to the mother language was erected in the garden, and April 14 was declared Mother Language Day. If you visit the park, you should definitely take a walk on the dry bridge, where you can find many original and interesting items.
