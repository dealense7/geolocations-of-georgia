The lake is difficult to access as there is no path leading to it, therefore, most of the time hikers tent to enjoy the view at the lake from the pass. The lake is very close to the Kalalish Toba.","tags":["Nature","Lake","Water"],"bestTimeToVisit":"July,August,September","duration":"3 days","images":["886947c4-558fc-4f63-9130-bd1cdb5e749708.jpg","bc6d0a9b-326c8-4272-a647-97b155a980b627.jpg"],"location":"Samegrelo"}]
