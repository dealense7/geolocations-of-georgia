Earlier, gardens in this area stretched from the Blue Monastery to the confluence of the Vere River with the Mtkvari. In the following period, part of the gardens were dedicated to the cemetery. In 1898, when urban development covered much of Verisubani, the government abolished the cemetery and began arranging the garden. During the Soviet era, the garden was named after Sergei Kirov, and in 1933 its improvement began. After the restoration of Georgia's independence, the garden was returned to its traditional name.","tags":["Nature","Garden","Park"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"","images":["bb7ca7a5-af7cd-45a0-afa2-843c9d3e2173e9.svg","c3b84bbf-0aa44-4590-82dd-6660562a77acf2.svg","f726fd33-46795-4215-8564-c7881271a5a1f6.svg","16a87a2c-ac7a8-43ab-b097-367dbf6eeda4d4.svg","20780ff9-1f332-4a1d-b3ce-a9370d3d4f8931.svg"],"location":"Tbilisi"}]
