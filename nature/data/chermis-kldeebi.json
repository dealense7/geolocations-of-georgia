[{"title":"Cheremi Rocks","categories":"Nature","pin":"nature","coordinates":[],"about":"Cheremi Rocks - are situated on the side of Mtskheta-Mtianeti, in the municipality of Mtskheta, between the villages: Mukhatgverdi and Dighomi, 550-600 meters from sea level, on the right bank of the Mtkvari valley, on the mountainsides. It is a pseudo-karst, which is created by atmospheric factors. The shapes of it are composed of the rainwater and the wind, after the fission of sandstones and carrying out the grains. Here we come across the natural vault, which is known as “Chakiduli” (which means “hanging on” in Georgian). There is a hole shaped like a basin, with several squads of 0,5-1,5 meters diameter depth and 3 meters long natural bridge. Those unique forms of Chermi Rocs are really very interesting sightings.","tags":["Nature"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"","images":[],"location":"Mtskheta - Mtianeti"}]
