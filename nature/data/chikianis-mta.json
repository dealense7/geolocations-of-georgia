The mountainsides of it are covered with subalpine fields and herbaceous plants. Here is also the Paravani obsidian layer. Nearby the Chikiani Mountain, there was discovered a “workshop”, for creating instruments and tools in the Paleolithic era. It is known as the “Workshop in the Open-air”. Not a hundred miles away, there is also situated a megalithic monument, dated to the Bronze Age- Chikiani menhir (stone pillar). In old times, this statue had a cultic prescription. Marvelous surroundings and ancient history are why this place has surprisingly attractive. ","tags":["mountain","Nature"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"1 hour","images":[]}]
