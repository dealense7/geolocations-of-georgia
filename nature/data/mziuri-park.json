The misty forest park and diversity create a wonderful environment for both children and adults. This garden has somehow become a symbol of kindness and fabulous world and is one of the most special places in the city. The idea of ​​establishing Mziuri belongs to Georgian writer Nodar Dumbadze. In 1975, in the newspaper Literaturuli Sakartvelo, he wrote: How do you think of building a park From Vere river to Chavchavadze Avenue and built our own :Disneyland?\".  A whole group of architects worked on the park project. It opened in 1982. As a result of the floods in the Vere River Valley on June 13, 2015, the park was severely damaged, but is now being renovated and becoming more and more active and full of life. Sunny is one of the best places to unwind, relax, spend the day with your family.","tags":["Nature","Garden","Park"],"bestTimeToVisit":"AllSeason","duration":"","images":["c6de9c51-2066c-488c-8f6a-0f2ed25b3ed344.jpg","e0d779e9-5195e-4a73-9164-4a315854c08e25.jpg","71e44f1b-5117d-40ee-913c-884321be698193.jpg","7d7b772e-40e57-450e-b166-7e236fbb44d3d9.jpg","7d0d0b57-28f7b-4783-8115-655af294215b39.jpg"],"location":"Tbilisi"}]
