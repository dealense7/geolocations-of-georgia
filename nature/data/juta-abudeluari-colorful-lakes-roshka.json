The landscape, heated by the sun and snow melting, gives you an opportunity to climb 4000 meters height without any special equipment. To do so, you only need a tent and waterproof shoes. In the region of Mtsheta-Mtianeti, there is one of the most beautiful and popular crossings from Khevi to Khevsureti, which is the hiking track of Juta-Abudelauri lakes. The route starts in Juta- at one of the highly populated spots (2200 meters above sea level) and ends in Roshka.
