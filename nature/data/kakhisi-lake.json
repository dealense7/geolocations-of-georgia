You can get there by 4X4 car, or by walking. This place is not famous, so if you want to find a quiet place, love fishing and wild raspberries this place is definitely for you. There was a time, about 15 years ago, when the lake was so clean, that one was able to dive without water glasses. Itâ€™s told, that fisherman could catch one meter long fish, like giant cobras and 2 kilo river carps. They used to go fishing there with water guns, as the lake water was sparkling clean. Nowadays the situation has changed a little, the water is not as sparkling as it once was, but you can still enjoy fishing here. The area is especially stunning in May and June, when the flowers are in full bloom near the lake. The lake has two shores, one is for camping and the other - to pick wild berries, as red and sweet as granny's baked strawberry pudding. They will make your day more beautiful, so this is the perfect place for camping and relaxation. The maximum depth of the lake is 10 meters, and around the lake there is a spruce forest. The road to Kakhisi is not hard, it is very beautiful, the views are getting more and more beautiful, firewood is everywhere, so you can collect and set a camp, eat fried mushrooms and enjoy. Also, you can spend those days without meeting other hikers.","tags":["Nature","Lake","Water"],"bestTimeToVisit":"Spring,Summer,Autumn","duration":"","images":["89073b79-9dfc-4651-aed6-f5fb8406e71c.jpg","7200a59a-9ea6-4082-90b8-681e9299e8ca.jpg"]}]
