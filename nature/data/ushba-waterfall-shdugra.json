Located in Svaneti, near Mazera village. You can reach both, the bottom of the waterfall, as the overhead of it. If you get overhead, you will be able to see the glacier at the bottom of the Ushba, also, wonderful views all over the Svaneti. The path, which leads you to the waterfall, is about 3 kilometers long, (with one direction). If you want to get to the head of the waterfall, then you will have to walk extra 3 kilometers. The last part of the path belongs to medieval complexity. Also, you will have to cross the river, but believe me, itâ€™s worth seeing.","tags":["Nature","Waterfall","Water"],"bestTimeToVisit":"Spring,Summer,Autumn","duration":"5 hours","images":["dd88e6c3-d0f4e-43d3-b5c6-4a04b917318c96.jpg","10df5d31-1ce39-430c-995f-4e21ce88b66702.jpg","8b3155d2-bab61-449c-8360-5d18d3495b6794.jpg","6b457f8e-d696e-4b80-8d4b-21f495ab3a8271.jpg","958dda0e-5265c-4ada-ae37-3205ecd766fcd4.jpg"],"location":", Mestia "}]
